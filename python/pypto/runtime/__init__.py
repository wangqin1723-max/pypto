"""
PyPTO runtime module.

Provides utilities for compiling a ``@pl.program`` and running it on an
Ascend NPU (or simulator) with result validation against a user-supplied
golden reference function.

Example::

    import torch
    from pypto.runtime import run, RunConfig, TensorSpec

    def golden(tensors, params):
        tensors["out"][:] = tensors["a"] + tensors["b"]

    result = run(
        program=MyProgram,
        tensor_specs=[
            TensorSpec("a",   [128, 128], torch.float32, init_value=2.0),
            TensorSpec("b",   [128, 128], torch.float32, init_value=3.0),
            TensorSpec("out", [128, 128], torch.float32, is_output=True),
        ],
        golden=golden,
        config=RunConfig(platform="a2a3sim"),
    )
    print(result)
