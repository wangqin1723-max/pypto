# Address PR Comments Workflow

Intelligently triage PR review comments, address actionable feedback, and resolve informational comments.

## Input

Accept PR number (`123`, `#123`) or branch name (`feature-branch`).

## Workflow

1. Match input to PR → 2. Fetch comments → 3. Classify → 4. Get user confirmation → 5. Address → 6. Resolve

## Step 1: Match Input to PR

```bash
# PR number
gh pr view <number> --json number,title,headRefName,state

# Branch name (use current if not specified)
git branch --show-current
gh pr list --head <branch> --json number,title,state,headRefName
```

Verify PR exists and show title/number for confirmation.

## Step 2: Fetch PR Comments

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json reviewThreads
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<number>/comments
```

Extract: comment ID, body, file path, line number, author, thread resolution status. Filter to **unresolved only** using `reviewThreads.isResolved`.

## Step 3: Classify Comments

| Category             | Description           | Examples                                                            |
|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A: Actionable**    | Requires code changes | Bugs, missing validation, security issues, requested features       |
| **B: Discussable**   | May not need changes  | Style preferences when code follows rules, premature optimizations  |
| **C: Informational** | Resolve as-is         | Acknowledgments, "optional" suggestions, questions answered in code |

**Present summary:**

```text
PR #<number>: <title>

📋 Comment Analysis:

Category A - Actionable (requires code changes):
  1. [file.py:42] Fix validation bug - doesn't handle negatives
  2. [foo.cpp:15] Add null pointer check

Category B - Discussable (may skip):
  3. [bar.py:88] Use list comp over map()
     Reason: Current follows .claude/rules/python-style.md - both acceptable

Category C - Informational (resolve):
  4. [readme.md:10] "Thanks for adding this!"

Recommendations: Address #1-2, Discuss #3, Resolve #4
```

For Category B, explain why code may already follow `.claude/rules/`.

## Step 4: Get User Confirmation

Use `AskUserQuestion` for each Category B comment:

- **Address** - Make code changes
- **Skip** - Resolve with explanation, no changes
- **Discuss** - Need reviewer clarification

## Step 5: Address Comments

For Category A + approved Category B:

1. Read file with Read tool
2. Make changes with Edit tool
3. Verify change addresses comment

```bash
git diff
git add <file1> <file2>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(pr): resolve review comments for #<number>

- Fixed validation bug (comment #1)
- Added null check (comment #2)
EOF
)"
git push
```

## Step 6: Resolve Comments

For **all addressed comments** (Category A, B, C), reply and mark as resolved:

```bash
# Reply to comment
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<number>/comments/<id>/replies \
  -f body="<response>"

# Resolve conversation using GraphQL
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation {
    resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "<thread_node_id>"}) {
      thread { isResolved }
    }
  }'
```

**Get thread_node_id from comment:** Use `node_id` field from comment data.

**Response templates:**

- Fixed (Category A): "Fixed in `<commit>` - brief description of fix"
- Skip (Category B): "Current approach follows `.claude/rules/python-style.md` for consistency"
- Acknowledged (Category C): "Acknowledged, thank you!"

## Best Practices

| Area              | Guidelines                                                                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Analysis**      | Reference `.claude/rules/` when classifying; be conservative (when unsure → Category B)     |
| **Code Changes**  | Read full context; minimal targeted changes; follow `.claude/rules/` conventions            |
| **Communication** | Be respectful; explain reasoning for skips; reference specific rules                        |

## Error Handling

| Error              | Action                                                                    |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PR not found       | `gh pr list --json number,title,headRefName`; ask user to confirm         |
| Not authenticated  | "Please run: `gh auth login`"                                             |
| Unclear comment    | Mark Category B for user discussion                                       |

## Checklist

- [ ] PR matched and validated
- [ ] Unresolved comments fetched and classified
- [ ] Category B items reviewed with user
- [ ] Code changes made and committed
- [ ] Informational comments resolved with replies

## Remember

**Not all comments require code changes.** Evaluate against `.claude/rules/` before making changes. When in doubt, consult user.
